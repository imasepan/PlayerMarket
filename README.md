# PlayerMarket API
The PlayerMarket API is a RESTful TypeScript backend system that will supplement the needs of the PlayerMarket webapp.

## Structure

Express + Playwright + Mongo (maybe SQL of some sort instead)

### ToDo
Everything. Design a schema and identify which routes are needed to fill tables.
